                <p>I am going to die. I am nothing in the grand scheme of things, so why should I bother? Why should I
                    do what
                    others tell me to do? Why should I conform to the general cuturescape when I can bend it and form a
                    reality
                    where I can evolve in who I want?</p>

    <h3>Quotes and Life Lessons</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An asset is something that puts money in my pocket whether I work or not. A liability is something that
            takes money out of my pocket. This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your
            life buying or building assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities.
            -page 85 of Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki</li>
        <li>Extraordinary minds are able to bend reality. They have bold and exiting visions for the
            future, yet their happiness is not tied to these visions. They are happy in the now. This balance allows
            them to move toward their visions at a much higher rate while having a ton of fun along the way. To
            outsiders, they seem “lucky”. -Page 130 of The Code of Extraordinary Life</li>
        <li>Although we don't have much control over what happens to us, we do have control over how it affects us, and
            we must use this control to great effect. -Zeno (stoic)</li>
